## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Rewards Program** as part of a coding challenge. The program simulates a reward point system where customers earn points based on their purchases and can redeem those points for rewards. 

The challenge demonstrates:
- Object-oriented design in Java (or your chosen language)
- Working with basic data structures
- Implementing business logic for a rewards system
- Handling edge cases and testing

## 🧠 Features

- **Customer Class**: Handles customer details and tracking of earned points.
- **Transaction Class**: Processes purchases and adds points based on the amount spent.
- **Rewards Class**: Redeems points for rewards and tracks points balance.
- **Point Calculation**: Earn points based on different thresholds or percentage of purchase amount.
- **Unit Testing**: Provides unit tests to validate logic such as point accumulation and redemption.
